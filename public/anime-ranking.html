<h1>The Best Anime According to Sukhdeep</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Best for fighting scenes, story depth and character are just perfect.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>The story don't even get me started on that, shock moments, forshadowing, how my brain just exploded after at the end of Season 3, the ending so unexpected still confused about that.</p>
<h3>Jujutsu kaisen</h3>
<p>Love the fights, gojo is op af, sukuna's character design, shibuya arc is just chef kiss.</p>
